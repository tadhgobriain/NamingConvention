Standard Naming Convention for hostnames/devices/instances/resources
Author: Tadhg Ó Briain

This is a discussion document and as such is far from exhaustive.
Constructive suggestions welcome. Please submit an issue.

Advantages:
(1) Reduces Active Directory naming conflicts
(2) Allows for better automation
(3) Can search for host groups more easily. e.g. How many virtual domain controllers of service_level 6 (infrastructure/production) are there in the AD forest?

Notes:
(1) https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/naming-conventions-for-computer-domain-site-ou

(2) component-type: This is not for host naming purposes

(3) location: for internal use only on, for example, network IP assignment docs

(4) Areas possibly still to deal with: WVD resource groups, mobile devices, loaned devices, Kubernetes cluster.

Key:
site/responsibility code:
The resource could be located on one of the below campuses or it could be a cloud resource but owned by specific site.
  c = city (Grangegorman/Bolton St.) All others sites scheduled for planned move to Grangegorman
  t = Tallaght
  b = Blanchardstown
  
functional_area:
This is entirely malleable and numbers assigned are unique, but for the most part, arbitrary. Perhaps these should match as best as possible across sites?
  Tallaght:
    01  = school of business
    10  = department of applied science
    20  = school of enterprise computing and digital transformation
    21  = Azure WVD (windows virtual desktop) resource group (school of enterprise computing and digital transformation)
    22  = Teaching cluster (school of enterprise computing and digital transformation)
    30  = school of engineering
    97  = staff desktops (could be split into different staff areas)
    98  = staff desktops (hotspots)
    99  = public terminals

os/hypervisor_type:
  w   = windows client
  ws  = windows server
  l   = linux client
  ls  = linux server
  m   = macOS
  ms  = macOS server
  h   = hyper-v
  e   = esxi/vmware
  k   = kvm
  p   = proxmox
  c   = citrix
  
device_type:
  p   = physical
  v   = virtual
  n   = nested (on self-hosted)
  l   = logical
  c   = container
  f   = function (e.g. Azure functions / AWS lambda)
  
service_level:
  0   = test
  1   = dev
  2   = teaching
  3   = general desktop use (non-teaching)
  4   = paas (platform as a service)
  5   = saas (software as a service) (may still need configuring or a reference name)
  6   = infrastructure (production)
 
owner:
Needed when admins need a jumpbox/test box.
May be used for developers (student/staff) needing dedicated boxes.
  gs  = Graham Smith (jumpbox/testbox for admins)
  tob = Tadhg Ó Briain (for admin jumpbox)

device_role:
  dc  = domain controller
  ds  = deployment server
  db  = database
  dbo = oracle database
  bkp = backup server
  sw  = switch
  lsw = logical switch
  vsw = virtual switch
  usw = unmanaged switch
  rt  = router
  san = storage area network
  nas = network attached storage
  cph = ceph storage

logical_grouping:
Will probably need to allow for more than 1...9 but could use functional area code to offset this.
    infrastructure:
      cl = cluster
    client:
      d  = vdi desktop

component_type:
  eth   = ethernet network device 
  oob   = out of band network port (management port)
  cns   = switch console port
  mgmt  = switch management port
  fbr   = fibre channel
  inf   = infiniband
  net   = ethernet network cable
  pwr   = power cable   

location:
'@' followed by {hypervisor|room|logical_grouping}

Nomenclature:
site/responsibility_code  = {t|b|c}
functional_area           = double digit integer 01,...,99
os/hypervisor_type        = {w|ws|l|ls|m|h|e|k|p|c}
device_type               = {p|v|l|c|f}
service_level             = [0|1|2|3|4|5]
owner                     = {gs|tob}
room                      = {001,002...,999}
device_role               = {dc|ds|db|dbo|bkp|sw|lsw|vsw|rt|san|nas|cph}
logical_grouping          = {cl}
number                    = client:{01,02..99}, server:{1,2..9}, node:{01,02..99}, device:{1,2..9}
component_type            = {eth|oob|ser}

Composition:
(1){site_code}{functional_area}-
      (2){os/hypervisor_type}{device_type}{service_level}-
		        (3){owner}-
		        (3){client logical group}-
		        (3){infrastructure logical group}-
			            (4){number}
		        (3){device_role}{number}	
	    (2){infrastructure logical_grouping}{number}-
		        (3){device_role}{number}
      (2){out of bound}-
		        (3){client logical group}-
            (3){infrastructure logical group}-
			            (4){number}
		        (3){device_role}{number}
        
Or to identify a device component on a device (not for host naming purposes) just append to name
-{component_type}{number}

Examples:
Hostnames:
t20-wp2-216-01: tallaght, school of enterprise computing, windows client, physical, desktop use, room 216, number 01
t20-wsp6-dc1: tallaght, school of enterprise computing, windows server, physical, infrastructure, domain controller, number 1
t20-lv0-tob-01: tallaght, school of enterprise computing, linux client, virtual, test, owner (Tadhg), number 01
t20-cl2-lsw2: tallaght, school of enterprise computing, cluster 2, logical switch 2
t20-ep6-cl1-05: tallaght, school of enterprise computing, esxi server, physical, infrastructure, cluster 1 (infrastrure logical group), node 05
t20-lv2-d02-01: tallaght, school of enterprise computing, linux client, virtual, teaching, desktop group 02 (client logical group (vdi)), number 01
t20-oob-cl2-03: tallaght, school of enterprise computing, oob, cluster 2, node 03

Nested cluster examples:
3 levels: L0 = physical, L1 = virtual, L2 = nested virtual
t22-ep6-cl4-03 : tallaght, teaching cluster (school of enterprise computing), esxi server, physical, infrastructure, node 03
t22-ev2-03-02 : tallaght, teaching cluster (school of enterprise computing), esxi server, virtual, teaching, logical group 03, node 02 
t22-wsn0-dc1: tallaght, teaching cluster (school of enterprise computing), windows server, nested, test, domain controller, number 1
For referencing, one can identify the guest's host by '@'. e.g. t22-wsn0-dc1@t22-ev2-03-02@t22-ep6-cl4-03
By using '22', a seperate functional area, instead of '20', it allows us more scope for group naming.

Device ID:
t20-wsp5-dc1-oob: tallaght, school of enterprise computing, windows server, physical, infrastructure, domain controller, number 1, out-of-band port
t20-cl2-sw2-ser: tallaght, school of enterprise computing, cluster 2, switch 2, serial port
